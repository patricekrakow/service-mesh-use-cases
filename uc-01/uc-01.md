# UC-01 | API Endpoint Access Control

Let's have `Alpha API` an _API_ with two _API endpoints_:

* `get /path-01`
* `get /path-02`

Let's have `client-x` a _service_ calling these two _API endpoints_.

Let's have `service-a` a _service_ implementing the two _API endpoints_ of `Alpha API`. More precisely, let's have the _version_ `1.0.0` of `service-a` implementing these two _API endpoints_.

__*WARNING.*__ The `client-x` MUST NOT know the implementation details of the `Alhpa API`, and that includes the _service_ which implements it. So, we could add an additional _network name_ like `aplha-api` that would represent the _API_. However, as the _API endpoints_ such as `get /path-01` and `get /path-02` are distinct throughout the whole organization, we can have only one unique network name such as `acme-api`. If, and only if, we would have a collision about two or more different _API endpoints_ having the same name, then, and only then, we can still use a different network name such as `<differentiator>.acme-api`.

The complete use case will cover the following scenario:

1. Without service mesh the `client-x` can access to the two API endpoints: `get /path-01` and `get /path-02`, implemented by the version `1.0.0` of the `service-a`.
2. With a service mesh, by default, the `client-x` does not have access to any API endpoints.
3. We will configure the service mesh, so the `client-x` can access to the two API endpoints: `get /path-01` and `get /path-02`.
